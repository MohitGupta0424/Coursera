                <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>
                     Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.
                     Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle
                     or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, 
                     and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.Chicken can be prepared in a vast 
                     range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, 
                     depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has 
                     become a staple of fast food.

                <p>
                    A veggie burger does not contain meat. A veggie burger patty may be made from ingredients 
          like beans, especially soybeans and tofu, nuts, grains, seeds or fungi such as mushrooms or 
          mycoprotein.The patties that are the essence of a veggie burger have existed in various Eurasian cuisines
           for millennia, including in the form of disc-shaped grilled or fried meatballs or as koftas, 
           a commonplace item in Indian cuisine. These may contain meats or be made of entirely vegetarian 
           ingredients such as legumes or other plant-derived proteins.

                <h2>Pizza</h2>
                <p>
                    Pizza is a traditional Italian dish consisting of a yeasted flatbread typically topped with
           tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven. It can also be topped with additional vegetables,
            meats, and condiments, and can be made without cheese. The term pizza was first recorded in 
            the 10th century, in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, 
            on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its 
            variants have since become popular and common in many areas of the world.
